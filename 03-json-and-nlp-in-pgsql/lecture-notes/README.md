# JSON and NLP in PostgreSQL

The JSON and NLP in PostgreSQL course by UMich through Coursera

---

## Overview

This course aims to use inverted indexes in PostgreSQL for JSON and natural language content processing. 

We will use various sources of data for our databases, including 

- Access to an online API

- Spidering its data, and 

- Storing the data in a JSON column in PostgreSQL.  

Students will explore how full-text inverted indexes are structured.  Students will build their own inverted indexes and then make use of PostgreSQL built-in capabilities to support full-text indexes
